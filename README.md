## What the feeder does
The industrial Strength Cat Feeder is a pet feeder project which is web/internet based:
Computer (raspberry pi) controlled 
Operated by web server
Web server displays current photo of bowl
Web server has buttons to: feed on demand, take new photo, easily customize automatic feeding times, indicate how much food has been dispensed 
Feed Various amounts of kibble at various times of day - easily customized
Emails photos before and after feeding to verify operation
Take picture on demand
Web server displays current photo of bowl on web site

This feeder is actually designed as a subpart for an outdoor feral cat feeding system. The outdoor feeding system contains two of these feeders for redundancy in case of a failure.The outdoor system is raccoon proof. It is designed to be operated unattended for long periods of time. I will link the larger outdoor system at a later date.
